def measure_worms(experiment_root, positions, measures, measurement_name, n_jobs=1):
    """Apply one or more measurement functions to all or some worms in an experiment.

    The measurements are class instances that produce and save files (such as
    image-segmentation tools), or produce timecourse data from image data (or
    other files produces) and/or from experimental annotations. Any timecourse
    data produced is saved into a named .tsv file for each position, with the
    worm simply named as the position name.

    measure_worms can be run more than once on a given experiment_root with
    different subsets of positions and measurements, if some measurements don't
    make sense to apply to all timepoints (for example), or if some measurements
    are run later on (or are run in parallel on the cluster, perhaps). To prevent
    collisions, the output data produced by different runs of measure_worms
    should be identified with distinct values of the measurement_name parameter.

    The function collate_data can then be used to merge all these .tsv files
    together into one authoriatative file for the experimental measurements.

    Parameters:
        experiment_root: the path to an experimental directory.
        positions: dict mapping position names to annotations (e.g. as returned
            by load_data.read_annotations). Only the positions and timepoints
            listed will be measured, so load_data.filter_annotations can be used
            to restrict measurements to a useful subset. In particular, use of
            load_data.filter_living_timepoints filter-function with
            filter_annotations is recommended:
                positions = load_data.read_annotations('path/to/experiment')
                to_measure = load_data.filter_annotations(positions, load_data.filter_living_timepoints)
        measures: list of measurements to apply to each timepoint. A measurement
            must (1) have an attribute 'feature_names' which is a list of the
            names of the measurement(s) it produces, and (2) have a 'measure'
            method that will be called as:
                data = measure(position_root, timepoint, annotations, before, after)
            where the parameters are as follows:
                position_root: path to directory of data files for the position
                    (i.e. experiment_root / position_name)
                timepoint: name of the timepoint to be measured
                annotations: annotation dict for this position at the given
                    timepoint
                before, after: annotation dictionaries (or None) for the
                    previous and next timepoints, if any. This enables
                    measurements based on the changes between annotations.
            and the return value must be a list of measurements of the same
            length as the feature_names attribute, or nan if that measurement
            cannot be made on the given worm and timepoint (e.g. missing data).
            If a measurement produces no data (e.g. it only produces file output,
            such as segmentation masks), then feature_names may be None, and
            the return value of measure must also be None.
            If a measurement wishes to write out data file(s), they should be
            stored as:
            '{experiment_root}/derived_data/{name}/{position_name}/{timepoint}.ext'
            where 'name' is a unique name for this type of data, and
            'position_name' can be obtained as position_root.name. If multiple
            related datafiles need to be saved, they cound be saved as:
            '{timepoint} {suffix}.ext' for whatever set of suffixes are needed.
        measurement_name: the name of this set of measurements. The .tsv files
            produced by this function (one for each position) will be written
            to '{experiment_root}/derived_data/measurements/{measurement_name}'
        n_jobs: if > 1, divide the provided positions dictionary into this many
            parts and run the measurements in parallel via the multiprocessing
            library.

    Below is an example of performing some measurements on all worms and others
    on only a subset. (In practice, however, it generally makes more sense to
    apply all measures to all data. A properly-written measurement function
    will return None when the required data is missing, producing .tsv files
    with lots of blank spaces. This is just fine and is simpler.)
