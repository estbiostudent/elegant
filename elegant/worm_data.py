    """Read worm data files into a Worms object.

    Each file can be either a single-worm file (where the "timepoint" identifier
    is the first column), or a multi-worm file (which has timepoint data for
    multiple worms concatenated, and has "name" as the column to disambiguate
    each worm).

    In the case of a single-worm file, the name of the worm is the name of the
    input file (minus any file extension), with an optional prefix prepended.
    In the case of a multi-worm file, the name of the worm is given in the
    "name" column, again optionally prepended by a prefix.

    The prefix is useful to distinguish animals from different experimental runs
    or genotypes, &c.

    Each data file must have at a minimum a "timepoint" column and an "age" column.
    For single-worm files, the "timepoint" column need not be labeled in the
    header, as it is assumed to be the first column. Multi-worm files must have
    the first column labeled "name" or "worm", and a labeled "timepoint" column
    elsewhere.

    Summary files containing worm-level data (i.e. lifespan &c., as opposed to
    the timepoint-level annotations in the worm files) can also be provided.
    If no lifespan data is present from a summary file, it will be calculated
    if requested. If 'timestamp' and 'stage' columns are present, the various
    ages (age, adult_age, ghost_age) and spans (lifespan, adultspan, &c.) will
    be calculated therefrom. Failing that, if an 'age' column is available,
    the lifespan will be calculated from that, as controlled by the
    'last_timepoint_is_first_dead' paramter.

    Parameters:
        *path_globs: all non-keyword arguments are treated as paths to worm data
            files, or as glob expressions matching multiple such data files.
        name_prefix: if a string, this will be used as the prefix (see above).
            If a function, it will be called with the pathlib.Path of the input
            file in question, so that the file name and/or name of the parent
            directories can be used to compute the prefix.
        delimiter: controls whether the data are assumed to be tab, comma, or
            otherwise delimited.
        summary_globs: if not None, either a single glob expression (or file path)
            or a list of same. These will be interpreted as summary data files
            to load (i.e. files of worm-level data, such as lifespan &c.,
            rather than timepoint-level annotations).
        calculate_lifespan: if True and if no lifespan data is present, then
            calculate lifespans (and other spans potentially), as described.
        last_timepoint_is_first_dead: if True, the last timepoint in the data
            file is assumed to represent the first time the worm was annotated
            as dead. Otherwise, the last timepoint is assumed to represent the
            last time the worm was known to be alive. Only used when lifespans
            are auto-calculated and when there are no 'timestamp' and 'stage'
            columns.
        time_units: the unit of time for the values in the "age" column and any
            column ending in "_age". This unit will also be used for summary
            columns ending in "span". All time units will be converted into
            hours internally. (The rescale_time() method can be used to
            change units later, but this is at your own risk: all time-based
            analysis code can and should assume time units of hours.)
            Must be one of 'days', 'hours', 'minutes', or 'seconds'.

        summary_features: names of summary feature to average across each of the

        Use linear interpolation to estimate the value of a given timecourse
        feature at one or more arbitrary times. Useful for calculating feature
        values across multiple worms on a uniform time-basis.

        Parameters:
            feature: the name of a timecourse feature available in worm.td to
                retrieve (such as "gfp_95th", say), or a function that will be
                called as feature(worm) that will calculate a timecourse feature

            age: a single age or a list/array of ages at which to interpolate
                the feature values.
            age_feature: the name of the feature to use to determine the ages.
                Defaults to 'age', but other monotonic features, such as
                a time-left-alive 'ghost_age' could also be used. If this is a
                function, it will be called as age_feature(worm) to generate
                the ages to examine (see documentation/examples for
                get_age_range).

        Returns the level or levels of the feature at the specified age(s).

        Example:
            day7gfp = worm.interpolate_feature('gfp_95th', 7)
            daily_gfp = worm.interpolate_feature('gfp_95th', numpy.arange(3, 7))

        """Smooth a feature with a given filter-function.

        Data points within a given age range will be smooothed with a given
        filter function. The pre-defined gaussian and uniform filters will
        smooth the data with a gaussian- or un-weighted average (respectively)
        of the data points previous to each current point. (I.e. these will be
        "causal" filters that do not incorporate future data.)

        For each timepoint in the selected time range, the filter function will
        be called as filter(ages, age_to_smooth, **filter_params), where the
        ages parameter contains the age at which each data point was acquired,
        and the age_to_smooth parameter is the particular age at to get a
        smoothed value for. The smoothing filter then chooses how to weight
        each data point based on its temporal distance from the age under
        consideration. The smoothing filter returns the weights for each
        timepoint in the range, and a weighted average of the data in that
        range is calculated.

        The resulting smoothed data will be stored in a td attribute with the
        name "smoothed_{feature}". Data points outside the provided time range
        will be un-smoothed in this output.

        Parameters:
            feature: feature to filter over
            filter: a smoothing filter that will be called as
                filter(ages, age_to_smooth). Use of the pre-defined
                gaussian_filter and uniform_filter functions is encouraged.
            age_feature: the name of the feature to use to determine the age
                window (as used by get_time_range).
            min_age, max_age: Limits between which to perform filtering;
                outside this range, no filtering is performed.
            **filter_params: Additional parameters passed to the filter function.
                In particular, uniform_filter requires a "window_size"
                parameter, which defines the temporal window size that the filter
                averages over. The gaussian_filter function requires a "sigma"
                parameter giving the temporal standard deviation; it also takes
                an optional "window_size" parameter.
